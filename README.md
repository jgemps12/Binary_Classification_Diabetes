# Predicting the Presence of Diabetes with Binary Classification

## About this Project:
This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to solve a **binary classification** problem. The problem centers on whether a hospital patient:

> **0** - does not have diabetes.

> **1** - has diabetes.

Multiple CNN configurations are tested and analyzed to determine the best possible model for solving this problem. Once the ideal model is selected, each feature in Kaggle's ***Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset*** is observed to determine their importance in the model's predictions. 

Preliminary steps--such as exploring the dataset, cleaning the dataset, and building an overfitting model for testing purposes--are conducted as well.

## Dataset:
This project uses the ***Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset*** from Kaggle. 

Due to Kaggle's licensing terms, the dataset is not included in this repository.

You can download the data from:
